capturing and analyzing network using Wireshark
Hereâ€™s a summarized version of your Wireshark capture, formatted for inclusion in a GitHub repository `README.md` or report:

---
Objective

Capture and analyze network packets to identify basic protocols and understand traffic patterns.

Deliverables

* `.pcapng` file containing captured packets
* Summary report of findings
*  
---

Summary of Findings

Protocols Identified:
The following protocols were observed in the network capture:

*TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)
*UDP(User Datagram Protocol)
*DNS(Domain Name System)
*HTTP(HyperText Transfer Protocol)
*TLSv1.2(Transport Layer Security)
*QUIC
*MDNS (Multicast DNS)
*ICMPv6
*ARP(Address Resolution Protocol)
*SSDP(Simple Service Discovery Protocol)

> Total unique protocols detected: **10**

Sample Packet Activity

A few representative examples of captured packet summaries include:

* TCP packet to port 443 (HTTPS connection)
* DNS request for domain resolution
* ARP broadcast resolving IP to MAC
* HTTP GET request from browser
* ICMPv6 ping traffic

---

Outcome

This activity provided hands-on experience with:

* Using **Wireshark** for live traffic capture
* Identifying and filtering packets by protocol
* Understanding how protocols interact in real-time network communication
